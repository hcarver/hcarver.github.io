At the very start, you'll need to work really hard to get customers. That's worth a separate blog post in itself, but the two most common ideas are free trials and "concierge" service.

First, it might be easiest to offer your users a free time-limited trial and later convert them to paying customers. Even with everything you've already done, there are likely to be problems with your solution and missing features that are genuinely vital. The goodwill and testimonials you get from your early customers will help a lot in spreading the word about your product and getting future customers.

Secondly, you can offer your first customers a "concierge service". This is where you interact directly with a small number of users, check how their experience of the product is, and generally focus on them and make sure that they think the product is perfect. Later you can automate these interactions, but in the early days, they will show your customers how much you value them, and they'll give you the feedback you need to perfect your product before expanding to a wider audience.
