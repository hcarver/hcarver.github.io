There are two kinds of startups dominating the startup world at the moment. Run your startup however you want but do it **consciously**. Make a decision about the kind of startup you want to run, don't stumble into it blindly.

## Casino Startups
*Casino startup* is my term for startups that delay profit in the hope of a "big win" later.

Hallmarks of a casino startup are:

- building a substantial product before making any money
- building startups based on an idea that lots of people want rather than a problem that lots of people suffer
- taking investment as a way of buying time and customers before generating profit

Everyone can name some successful casino startups. Facebook. WhatsApp. Google. Twitter.

Just kidding about that last one. See, all of these companies have one thing in common - we've all heard of them. They're all cool services and household names. But they're not all companies you'd want to be running. No way.

Check out [Twitter's net income for the last 4 years](http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/twtr/financials): 2010: ($67.32M) 2011: ($128.3M) 2012: ($79.4M) 2013: ($645.32M).

For me this perfectly illustrates the nature of the casino startup. The success stories are huge, becoming household names and making very few people very, very rich. The failures are rarely public but when they are, they demonstrate exponential growth in the wrong direction. Yearly losses growing to $645M is huge.

This is a direct result of scaling a business that doesn't make money. By getting that investment to grow a business that isn't profitable, you're saying "we've done the hard bit and built something lots of people want, now give us some money so we can carry on getting it to more people. When we've done that we'll do the easy bit of making money from our massive userbase."

Which is totally the wrong way round. Building things people will pay for is hard. Building popular things people will pay for is incredibly hard. Building popular things is easy. If you don't believe me, spend half an hour on a busy high street under a sign that says "Free £5 / $5 for everyone". Yes, it's a stupid example, but it's an even stupider business model to think you can give something away for free now that will definitely make you money later.

## But he who dares wins, right? Sometimes?
Definitely. Hence the term *Casino Startup*. Some of those founders win really, really big. The rest waste their time creating beautiful projects that never take off, and regret it later.

Investors tend to win from Casino Startups too. If they invest in 20 startups, 19 of them die and 1 becomes huge, they're set for life.

Users often win from Casino Startups too. Users get a brilliant product built by passionate people for free. For a while at least.

The people who suffer most are the founders who invest their lives in enterprises that have no future.

## Indie Startups
This is a term I'm trying out for the other kind of startup you see. Broadly, this means a startup that won't invest time or money into an idea until it can sniff money. Hallmarks are

- Projects that start small, doing a single thing well
- Companies that seek investment only to grow profits
- Steady growth
- Solving a problem that makes someone else's life easier or more profitable.

Indie Startups are less likely to be public so their accounts are harder to find. How about [Freckle](www.letsfreckle.com)?

Freckle is a startup product by Amy Hoy that makes it super-easy for a company to track how its employees spend their time and generate invoices to their clients. Their [financials were featured in a blog post](http://unicornfree.com/2013/5-years-of-saas-growth-every-month-exact-numbers).

Freckle started out by solving a real problem and making $13 a day in its first month. In its first year, it showed consistent growth, rising to about $120 a day. This carried on increasing over the next year towards $500 a day. In the last year (Freckle's fifth), they made about $1000 a day.

This is exponential growth of the kind you'd want.

## Which would you rather?
Would you rather be CEO of Twitter right now? With hundreds of millions of users, after a successful IPO, losing hundreds of millions of dollars a year?

Or would you rather own Freckle? With 5 years of exponential growth, hitting over $365,000 a year?

Whichever kind of company you'd rather run, know the risks and decide consciously.
