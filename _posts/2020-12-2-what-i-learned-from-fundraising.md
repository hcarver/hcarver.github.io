Most posts with this title read like self-owns to me. Like, "10 things I learned from fundraising" could most often
be retitled "I didn't do any research before fundraising, and here's what everyone else already knew."

I think I've read a lot about fundraising, and learned from other people who I respect. There were still some things
that surprise me.

### Team size doesn't matter

It seems obvious to me that a team of 2 whose company is making £5k a month is more investable than a team of 10 making
£10k a month. Investors I spoke to gave me the opposite impression.

### Measuring by money

This makes more sense to me for a Series A / B / C round. But measuring an early stage company by money rather than
learning is just daft. I guess it's evidence that investors are rarely executors (at least in Europe - I think this
is different in the UK). And that certainly is something you can read on everyone else's fundraising postmortem so I'm
not going to say more about it here.
